There are currently two ways to 
estimate the probability of an option being
"in-the-money" in using the [Black-Scholes-Merton model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model).

1. [Naive estimate](#itm)
2. [Through `dual_delta`](#dual-delta)

## Parameters

Reference of all symbols that are used in the formulas:

`$T$` = Time to maturity (in years)

`$r$` = Risk-free rate

`$q$` = Annual dividend yield

`$\Phi(.)$` = Cumulative Density Function (CDF) of  `$\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$`

`$d_1 = \frac{ln(\frac{S}{K}) + (r - q + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}$`

`$d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{T}$`



## 1. Naive estimate <a name="itm"></a>

There is a parity between this estimate for calls and puts. 
In other words, the estimate of a call plus that of a put with same input parameters always equals `$1$`.

### Call

$$\Phi(d_2)$$

::: blackscholes.call.BlackScholesCall.in_the_money


### Put

$$1 - \Phi(d_2)$$

::: blackscholes.put.BlackScholesPut.in_the_money

## 2. Dual Delta <a name="dual-delta"></a>

Dual delta is an option Greek that also happens to provide a good estimate of the probability
that an option will expire in-the-money. 

There is a parity between the dual delta for calls and puts. 
In other words, the dual delta of call plus dual delta of put with same input parameters always equals `$1$`.

### Call

$$-e^{-rT}\Phi(d_2)$$

::: blackscholes.call.BlackScholesCall.dual_delta


### Put

$$e^{-rT}\Phi(-d_2)$$

::: blackscholes.put.BlackScholesPut.dual_delta

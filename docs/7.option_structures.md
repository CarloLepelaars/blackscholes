Several options can be compounded in what we call "Option Structures". 
This allows us to hedge out directional bets and bet purely on volatility.

The structures that we discuss here:

1. Straddle
2. Strangle
3. Butterfly
4. Iron Condor

All structures have a long and short version.

## Parameters

Reference of all symbols that are used in the formulas:

`$C$` = Call option

`$P$` = Put option

`$K$` = Strike price

## Straddle

Straddles are built a call and put option with the same strike price `$K$`.

Long straddle: `$P(K) + C(K)$`

Put straddle: `$-P(K) - C(K)$`

To get compounded attributes, use `BlackScholesStraddle`.
